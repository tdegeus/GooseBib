abstract = {Sliding at a quasi-statically loaded frictional interface can occur via macroscopic slip events, which nucleate locally before propagating as rupture fronts very similar to fracture. We introduce a microscopic model of a frictional interface that includes asperity-level disorder, elastic interaction between local slip events, and inertia. For a perfectly flat and homogeneously loaded interface, we find that slip is nucleated by avalanches of asperity detachments of extension larger than a critical radius A c governed by a Griffith criterion. We find that after slip, the density of asperities at a local distance to yielding x $\sigma$ presents a pseudogap P ( x $\sigma$ ) ∼ ( x $\sigma$ ) $\theta$ , where $\theta$ is a nonuniversal exponent that depends on the statistics of the disorder. This result makes a link between friction and the plasticity of amorphous materials where a pseudogap is also present. For friction, we find that a consequence is that stick–slip is an extremely slowly decaying finite-size effect, while the slip nucleation radius A c diverges as a $\theta$-dependent power law of the system size. We discuss how these predictions can be tested experimentally.},

abstract = {Multi-phase materials are key for modern engineering applications. They are generally characterized by a high strength and ductility. Many of these materials fail by ductile fracture of the, generally softer, matrix phase. In this work we systematically study the influence of the arrangement of the phases by correlating the microstructure of a two-phase material to the onset of ductile failure. A single topological feature is identified in which critical levels of damage are consistently indicated. It consists of a small region of the matrix phase with particles of the hard phase on both sides in a direction that depends on the applied deformation. Due to this configuration, a large tensile hydrostatic stress and plastic strain is observed inside the matrix, indicating high damage. This topological feature has, to some extent, been recognized before for certain multi-phase materials. This study however provides insight in the mechanics involved, including the influence of the loading conditions and the arrangement of the phases in the material surrounding the feature. Furthermore, a parameter study is performed to explore the influence of volume fraction and hardness of the inclusion phase. For the same macroscopic hardening response, the ductility is predicted to increase if the volume fraction of the hard phase increases while at the same time its hardness decreases.},

abstract = {We analyse the equilibrium pile-up configurations of infinite periodic walls of edge dislocations which are forced against an impenetrable obstacle by a constant applied shear stress. Numerically generated density distributions exhibit two distinct regions, for each of which we provide an interpretation and an analytical prediction. Near the obstacle, the influence of neighbouring slip planes may be neglected and the classical solution for a single slip plane applies. At a larger distance a linear decay is obtained. The characteristic length scales of the two parts of the pile-up are shown to depend differently on the parameters of the problem.},
